task: # you may define tasks from [a-z]0 to [a-z]99. py.* 
# By default tasks run in parallel. To run tasks in series, 
# prefix your task names by 's.' (e.g. s.aws.s3.mb11); 
# series execution is needed for tasks that require 
# a user input or the tasks that require other tasks to be 
# finished first. 

# Tasks in node.ve and python.ve will run within the existing 
# virtual env space of the project (see 'python' and 'node' keys above) 
#  if ve does not exist, pypman will complain. You can create
# ve using node.ve.cr or python.ve.cr

# You may define lists of tasks to execute multiple tasks in 
# a given order. You cannot use a list inside a list though.
